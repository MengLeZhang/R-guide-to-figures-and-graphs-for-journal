# R-guide-to-figures-and-graphs-for-journal
This consolidates my knowledge on producing figures and graphs for journals in R in a fast and easy way

The goal of this is to use markdown to produce graphs, tables and so forth without touching excel. This will produce files in html which can hopefully be converted to word or at least copy and pasted.

The current idea is:
1) Each guide produces a html doc with everything rendered
2) Each guide produces template code that we can use again and again for tables
